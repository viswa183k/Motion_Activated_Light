# 🚨 Motion Activated Light using PIR Sensor

This Arduino project uses a PIR sensor to detect motion and automatically turn on an LED. It's a basic simulation of motion-based lighting used in security and energy-saving applications.

## 🧠 Features

- Detects human motion using PIR sensor
- Activates an LED when motion is sensed
- Logs motion status to Serial Monitor
